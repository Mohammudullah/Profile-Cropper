This Is Edited version of Js image cropper tool(https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/) Please check out this if you need the original version of image cropper. I know the original version is more impressive then mine.

Why Edited:

1. This version has a modal popup functionality after uploading an image for cropping.
2. More mobile responsive.
3. Output is an image, not any blob file, which is easy for validation in the backend.
4. Has a simple backend functionality (PHP)
5. Specially designed for profile upload functionality.
6. Bootstrap friendly.

Please check out the original if you need more functionality for image cropping and the instructions.
